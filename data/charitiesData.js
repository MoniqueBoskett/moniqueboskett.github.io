    about: "At Achieve Now, we see literacy as a social justice issue. Our goal is to produce strong, confident, effective, and joyful readers who see reading as an integral part of their lives and are life-long learners. A parallel objective is to empower students to self-regulate; to share what they are feeling and articulate what they need; and to take ownership of their learning.\n\nTo realize these goals, we will affirm student identities, using values-driven and asset-based language. We will approach our students with high expectations and celebrate the many and varied skills students possess. We will build a broad, competent village, bringing multiple organizations together to provide wrap-around supports in a holistic approach that serves the whole student."
